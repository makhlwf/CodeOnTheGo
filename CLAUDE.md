# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (claude.ai/code) in this repository. This file is self-contained — Claude Code reads it on startup; the operational rules below live here, not in a separate file.

## What this is

Code On The Go (CoGo) is an Android IDE that runs *on the device* — edit, build, and deploy real Android apps from a phone, offline. It's the maintained successor to AndroidIDE, so the Gradle/AGP namespace stays `com.itsaky.androidide` even though the product is "Code On The Go". A bundled Termux provides the shell/toolchain; a `tooling-api` runs a real Gradle build inside the app.

## Build & test

Wrap every Gradle invocation in `flox` for the right toolchain:

```bash
flox activate -d flox/local -- ./gradlew <task>
```

- **Debug APK (arm64, the usual target):** `flox activate -d flox/local -- ./gradlew :app:assembleV8Debug --parallel --max-workers=6`
- **Single unit test:** `flox activate -d flox/local -- ./gradlew :module:test --tests "com.itsaky.androidide.SomeTest"`
- **Module unit tests:** `flox activate -d flox/local -- ./gradlew :testing:unit:test`

When the user names a CI/CD job ("the sonar job", "the analyze workflow"), read `.github/workflows/*.yml` — the YAML is the authoritative gradle/shell invocation. Don't reverse-engineer it from gradle tasks or build files.

### ABI product flavors (v7 / v8)

Every module carries `v7` (`armeabi-v7a`) and `v8` (`arm64-v8a`) flavors, so build tasks are `assembleV8Debug`, `assembleV7Release`, etc. — there is **no** flavorless `assembleDebug`. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) (Build & Module Configuration) for flavors, native asset bundling, and SDK levels.

### Emulator / device

At least one Android emulator or device is available. Find it with `adb devices -l | grep -v offline`, then target it with the `ANDROID_SERIAL` env var. Note the app is **arm-only** (`v7`/`v8` flavors, no x86) — an x86_64 emulator can't run it (not always even via a translation layer), so testing often needs a **physical arm device** or an arm-translation emulator.

## Architecture

See **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** — the single source of truth for the module map, layering/data flow, dependency rules, tech stack (DI, async, persistence, networking), state management, and testing strategy. Don't re-document those here; update ARCHITECTURE.md.

## Project-specific constraints

- **Avoid new dependencies** — the build almost certainly already has what's needed. Check `gradle/libs.versions.toml` and `build.gradle.kts` first.
- **Persistence:** prefer **Room** for relational data and the filesystem/preferences for settings; raw SQLite only for justified exceptions — see [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-prefer-room-for-persistence.md).
- **Protect the two Android system bars** in any UI work: the top status bar (clock, notifications, status icons) and the bottom navigation bar (home, back, recents). Don't draw over or intercept them.
- **Plan and size before building.** Prefer **one PR per ticket/use case** — don't force-split a coherent change (splitting has its own overhead when later edits span the pieces). When a change is large, break it into **reviewable commits** — mechanical/refactor commits separate from behavioral ones — and offer review-by-commit. Treat ~500 LOC / ~10 files as a signal to reach for that commit structure, not a hard cap; the ceiling rises as LLM-assisted review matures.
- **Keep docs in step with code.** When you change code, update the docs that describe it in the same change — a module's `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, or an ADR — so a doc never outlives the API it documents (see REVIEW.md, Code quality). If the doc fix is out of scope, file a ticket rather than let it drift.
- `.androidide_root` is a sentinel file tests use to locate the project root — don't delete it.
- Avoid http or https links which go off-device. When such links are unavoidable, warn the user beforehand and offer to cancel the action.

## Code style

**Tabs** for indentation, **LF** line endings — enforced by **Spotless** (`ratchetFrom = origin/stage`, so only changed lines are reformatted). Java uses the **Eclipse** formatter (`spotless.eclipse-java.xml`, with member sorting + import ordering); Kotlin and `*.gradle.kts` use **ktlint**; XML uses the **Eclipse WTP** formatter. Run `./gradlew spotlessApply` to fix formatting before pushing. Branch names must match `.../ADFA-#####` (3–5 digits) — see CONTRIBUTING.md; a pre-commit hook enforces it (`sh ./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`).

Keep docs, tickets, commit messages, and PR descriptions crisp — say it once, lead with the point, cut hedging and restated context. Brevity is the soul of wit; a reader's attention is the scarce resource.

**Code comments** follow the same discipline:
- Short and to-the-point: comment the non-obvious *why* (a workaround, a constraint, a subtle invariant), not what the code already states. Cut restated context.
- **No separator or decorative comments.** No banner bars, `// ====` rules, or ASCII-art dividers; let structure, naming, and small functions carry organization.
- **Prefer ASCII.** Don't use a non-ASCII character when an ASCII equivalent reads the same: `->` not the arrow glyph, `-` for a dash, straight quotes not curly. Scope: code and code comments. Exempt: Markdown prose, and diagrams/ASCII-art where a non-ASCII glyph does real visual work (e.g. the box-drawing in ARCHITECTURE.md's data-flow diagram) — keep those.

## Branch model

- **`main`** — release branch. It only ever receives merges **from `stage`**; nothing else targets `main` directly.
- **`stage`** — the protected default/integration branch (`origin/HEAD`) and the base for the Spotless ratchet. All feature work lands here first.
- **Feature branches** — always branched **from `stage`** and opened as PRs back **into `stage`**. Name internal branches `.../ADFA-#####` (see CONTRIBUTING.md; external community contributors use the `community/` prefix instead).

Flow: branch off `stage` → PR into `stage` → `stage` merges to `main` for release. Never branch a feature off `main`, and never target `main` with a feature PR.

## Operational rules

### Official/public actions run in CI, not locally

Anything official or public-facing runs only through version-controlled GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/*.yml`), never locally — SonarQube/SonarCloud uploads, releases, artifact publishing, deploys, pushes to external services. Tokens like `SONAR_TOKEN` are GitHub secrets scoped to those workflows; don't hunt for them locally. Asked to run e.g. the sonar task locally, treat it as verification only (build/test to confirm a fix) and let the official analysis happen in CI.

### Jira tickets — read, and keep updated

Read tickets with the local authenticated `jira` CLI (e.g. `jira issue view ADFA-1234`), configured via `JIRA_API_TOKEN`, `JIRA_HOST`, and `JIRA_USER`. Don't start the Atlassian MCP OAuth flow for reads — it's unnecessary when the CLI works.

**Post progress as you go.** The team wants visibility into in-progress work, not just a final drop. When you start a ticket, hit a notable blocker or decision, or finish a meaningful chunk, add a short comment (`jira issue comment add ADFA-#### "…"`). Keep it crisp — status, what changed, what's next.

### SonarQube MCP server

The sonarqube MCP server runs in Docker, so Docker must be up before launching Claude Code. Its first launch pulls a ~225MB image (`mcp/sonarqube:latest`) that exceeds Claude Code's 30s MCP handshake timeout — so the first connect reports a timeout though nothing is broken. Pre-pull the image (or let one launch finish) so later `/mcp` reconnects succeed. `docker system prune` removes it and brings back the slow first launch.

### Multi-line git/gh messages

Default to writing the body to a tempfile via the Write tool, then `git commit -F /tmp/msg.txt` or `gh pr create --body-file /tmp/body.md`. Use heredoc/`--body "$(cat <<EOF ...)"` only for short messages with no shell-special characters.

Many characters break the inline `"$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"` pattern: apostrophes trigger `bash: eval: unexpected EOF` (the outer `"$( ... )"` parses the apostrophe even though `<<'EOF'` quotes the heredoc), and backticks or arrows like `→` trigger `bad substitution`. The tempfile approach sidesteps all of them.
