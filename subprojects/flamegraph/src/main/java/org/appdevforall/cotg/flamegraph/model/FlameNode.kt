/**
 * A node in a weighted hierarchy rendered by the flamegraph.
 *
 * The tree is fully general-purpose: it can describe CPU samples, allocation sizes, retained heap,
 * on-disk sizes, or any other quantity that aggregates up a hierarchy.
 *
 * [value] is the **inclusive** (total) weight of the node and determines its width. A node's "self"
 * weight is `value - children.sumOf { it.value }`. Children are laid out left-to-right within the
 * horizontal band the parent occupies. Callers should keep `value >= children.sumOf { it.value }`;
 * inconsistent input is tolerated (the layout clamps it) but never produces a negative self weight.
 *
 * @param T type of the opaque [payload] returned to click callbacks. Use [Nothing] (the default for
 *   trees built without payloads) when no payload is needed.
