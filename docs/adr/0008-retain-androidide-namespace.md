# 0008. Retain the `com.itsaky.androidide` namespace after rebrand

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-06-18
- **Deciders:** Code On The Go team

## Context

Code On The Go is the rebranded successor to **AndroidIDE**. The product name, branding, and assets changed, but the inherited codebase carries the original identity deeply: the application id and Gradle namespace are `com.itsaky.androidide` (`BuildConfig.PACKAGE_NAME`), `rootProject.name` is `AndroidIDE`, plus many thousands of references, the generated `R` class, the manifest, package-qualified vendored substitutions, signing identity, and existing installs in the field.

Changing an Android **application id** breaks the update path for installed users (a different app id is a different app) and disrupts signing/identity continuity. A rename of this size also ripples through the vendored `com.itsaky.androidide.build:*` substitutions ([ADR 0003](0003-vendored-forked-desktop-toolchain.md)).

The decisive constraint, though, is the **terminal bootstrap packages** (built separately in `appdevforall/terminal-packages`): the package name is baked into them, so the app and the terminal packages must agree on it. It **cannot be changed incrementally** — you can't rename one side first and the other later. Any change has to be a single **atomic, big-bang** change spanning the terminal packages *and* this app, which rebuilds the terminal packages under the new name. That coupling is what makes a rename genuinely expensive, not just tedious.

## Decision

**Keep** the `com.itsaky.androidide` application id / namespace and the internal Gradle project names. Rebranding (`INTERNAL_NAME = "CodeOnTheGo"`, the app label, icons, and user-facing assets) is applied at the **presentation layer only**, not the package identity.

## Consequences

**Positive**
- Preserves the update path and signing continuity for existing installs.
- Avoids a massive, high-risk refactor and the churn it would cause across vendored substitutions and the `R` class.

**Negative / costs**
- The codebase namespace doesn't match the product name, confusing to newcomers. [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) call this out so the mismatch is expected, not surprising.
- Care is needed to ensure user-facing strings/branding are overridden and no "AndroidIDE" naming leaks to users.

## Alternatives considered

- **Full rename to `org.appdevforall.*`** — rejected: breaks updates for existing users, requires enormous error-prone churn, forces an atomic big-bang rebuild of the terminal bootstrap packages in lockstep, and risks destabilizing the vendored substitutions for little gain.
- **Partial rename** (some modules) — rejected: produces an inconsistent namespace with the same risks and no clean payoff.
