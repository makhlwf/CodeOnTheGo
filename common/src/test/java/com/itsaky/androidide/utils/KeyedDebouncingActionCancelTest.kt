/**
 * Repro for ADFA-4328: cancelling a [KeyedDebouncingAction] entry whose worker is
 * parked on `channel.receive()` must NOT let a [ClosedReceiveChannelException]
 * escape to the scope's uncaught-exception handler.
 *
 * On the pre-fix baseline, `ActionEntry.cancel()` did `channel.close()` BEFORE
 * `job.cancel()`. Closing the channel wakes the parked `receive()` with a
 * [ClosedReceiveChannelException] (NOT a CancellationException), which propagates
 * uncaught to the [CoroutineExceptionHandler] -> the Sentry crash this ticket fixes.
 *
 * The fix swaps the order (job.cancel() first) AND wraps the worker loop in a
 * try/catch that swallows ClosedReceiveChannelException, so no uncaught exception fires.
